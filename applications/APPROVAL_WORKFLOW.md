# ✅ Job Application Approval Workflow

## How It Works

### Step 1: I Find Jobs
- I search for internships matching your criteria
- Filter for: Sophomores, First-Gen, Hispanic-friendly programs
- Create GitHub Issue for each opportunity

### Step 2: You Review
Each job presented with:
- **Company & Role** (clear title)
- **Why It Fits** (sophomore/first-gen/Hispanic focus)
- **Key Requirements** (must-haves)
- **Location & Pay** (if listed)
- **Deadline** (if urgent)
- **Resume Version Needed** (Finance vs CS tailored)

### Step 3: You Decide
Reply with:
- **"APPLY"** → I tailor resume and submit
- **"SKIP"** → I mark as rejected and move on
- **"MORE INFO"** → I research deeper before deciding

### Step 4: I Execute
- Tailor resume to job requirements
- Fill application with your info
- Submit (or save draft for your final review)
- Update GitHub Issue as "Applied"
- Send you confirmation + next steps
